    "# This is a tutorial to work with cell painting data\n",
    "[Inspired from [pycitominer](https://github.com/cytomining/pipeline-examples/blob/main/1.profile.ipynb)]\n",
    "## ⚙️ Cell Painting Data Processing Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Aggregation\n",
    "After image analysis, **single-cell profiles** are generated from the segmented images.  \n",
    "Each **well** may contain multiple images corresponding to the same **perturbation or treatment**.  \n",
    "These single-cell profiles are **aggregated to the well level** (e.g., by computing the median or mean across cells).  \n",
    "The resulting well-level profiles are then **re-annotated with metadata** (plate, well, compound, concentration, etc.) to create a unified dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Normalization\n",
    "To ensure consistent comparisons across plates and experiments, **feature values are normalized** relative to control wells — typically **DMSO** for chemical perturbations.  \n",
    "Normalization removes plate-to-plate and systematic technical variability, allowing biological differences to be more accurately captured.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Feature Selection\n",
    "CellProfiler extracts thousands of features, many of which can be **redundant or highly correlated**.  \n",
    "To reduce noise and improve interpretability, **feature selection** is applied to retain only the most informative and non-redundant features.  \n",
    "This step improves data quality and computational efficiency for downstream analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Aggregation of Consensus Profiles\n",
    "Finally, **well-level profiles** corresponding to the same **perturbation or treatment** (e.g., multiple wells, replicates, or concentrations) are **aggregated into consensus profiles**.  \n",
    "These consensus profiles represent the **robust morphological signature** of each perturbation, which can be used for reproducibility assessment and biological interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Levels of Cell Painting Data Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Cell Painting data can be represented at multiple levels of processing, from raw microscopy images to consensus-level profiles.  \n",
    "Each level provides increasing abstraction and refinement of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Data Description**                              | **Level** | **Details** |\n",

    "| **Images**                                        | Level 1 | Raw microscopy images captured from the Cell Painting assay. Each image corresponds to a single field of view in a specific well and channel. |\n",
    "| **Single-cell profiles**                 | Level 2 | Per-cell morphological measurements extracted from images using for example *CellProfiler*. |\n",
    "| **Aggregated profiles with metadata information** | Level 3 | Single-cell profiles aggregated to the **well level** (e.g., median across all cells in a well) and annotated with **metadata** such as plate, well, and treatment. |\n",
    "| **Normalized aggregated profiles**                | Level 4a | Well-level profiles normalized relative to **control wells** (e.g., DMSO) to correct for plate or batch effects. |\n",
    "| **Normalized and feature-selected profiles**      | Level 4b | Normalized profiles with redundant or noisy features removed to retain only the **most informative and stable features**. |\n",
    "| **Consensus profiles**                            | Level 5 | Aggregation of replicate or multi-concentration profiles to create a **final consensus signature** per perturbation or treatment. Used for reproducibility assessment and biological interpretation. |\n",

    "## 📚 Glossary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plates**  \n",
    "Containers that hold multiple wells where cells are grown and treated with perturbations or compounds.  \n",
    "Cell Painting experiments commonly use **96-well** or **384-well** plates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wells**  \n",
    "Individual compartments within a plate. Each well contains a population of cells exposed to a specific **perturbation**, **treatment**, or **control** condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Batch**  \n",
    "A group of plates processed together under similar experimental conditions (e.g., same day, same microscope, same operator).  \n",
    "Batch information is critical for identifying and correcting **batch effects** — systematic differences unrelated to biology.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Profiles**  \n",
    "High-dimensional representations of cell morphology obtained after feature extraction.  \n",
    "Each profile summarizes thousands of **features** that describe cellular shape, texture, and intensity across multiple imaging channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features**  \n",
    "Quantitative measurements extracted from microscopy images (using software like CellProfiler).  \n",
    "Examples include cell size, nuclear intensity, texture patterns, and spatial relationships between organelles.  \n",
    "Features are often normalized and aggregated to create a **profile** per well, treatment, or cell population.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metadata**  \n",
    "Contextual information describing each sample, such as plate ID, well position, compound name, concentration, gene target, or imaging parameters.  \n",
    "Metadata allows linking image-derived features to experimental design and biological meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Perturbation / Treatment**  \n",
    "The experimental condition applied to cells to induce a phenotype of interest.  \n",
    "This can be:\n",
    "- A **chemical compound** (e.g., drug or small molecule). The same chemical tested at **different concentrations**  \n",
    "- A **genetic perturbation** (e.g., CRISPR knockout, RNAi, overexpression)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Replicate**  \n",
    "Repeated experimental samples under identical conditions (same perturbation, same concentration).  \n",
    "Used to assess reproducibility and calculate metrics such as **replicate correlation** or **GRIT**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Channel**  \n",
    "A fluorescence imaging band capturing a specific cellular component (e.g., nucleus, mitochondria, actin).  \n",
    "Each channel provides complementary morphological information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Aggregation**  \n",
    "The process of combining single-cell features into summary statistics (e.g., mean, median) at the well or treatment level using tools like **PyCytominer**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Normalization**  \n",
    "A data processing step to remove technical variability between wells or plates (e.g., z-score normalization, median-mAD scaling).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Batch Effect**  \n",
    "Non-biological differences introduced by technical variations between experiments or imaging runs.  \n",
    "Must be corrected if necessaryto ensure meaningful biological comparisons.\n"
