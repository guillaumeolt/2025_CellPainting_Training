# 🧪 Ewald Lab Training on Cell Painting Data
Welcome to the Ewald Lab Cell Painting Training Repository!
This repository provides a step-by-step tutorial for learning how to process, evaluate, and analyze Cell Painting datasets — from raw CellProfiler outputs to meaningful biological insights.
# 📘 Overview
The **Cell Painting assay** is a high-content imaging approach that captures morphological features of cells across multiple fluorescent channels.

This tutorial walks you through:
- Setting up the environment
- Processing CellProfiler output data
- Evaluating data quality and reproducibility
- Performing downstream analyses to link morphological profiles with biological activity
# 🧰 1. Prerequisites & Environment Setup
Before starting, ensure you have Python ≥ 3.9 and uv (for package management) installed.
Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ewald-lab/2025_CellPainting_Training.git
cd 2025_CellPainting_Training
```
Set up the environment and install dependencies:
```bash
uv venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```
# 📂 2. Data Preparation
You will need a Cell Painting dataset processed with CellProfiler.
Typical input data includes:
Image-based features (*.csv or *.parquet)
Metadata files (e.g., plate map, compound annotations)
If you do not yet have a dataset, you can download a public Cell Painting dataset, such as those available from the Broad Institute Cell Painting Gallery.
# ⚙️ 3. Data Processing
All steps for processing raw CellProfiler output into analysis-ready data are contained in:

📄 01_processing/01_processing.ipynb

Processing is performed using [PyCytominer](https://github.com/cytomining/pycytominer), a standard toolkit for Cell Painting data normalization, feature selection, and aggregation.
# 🔍 4. Experiment Evaluation
Evaluate data quality, reproducibility, and activity:

📄 01_processing/02_evaluate.ipynb

This notebook includes:
- Replicate correlations — assess consistency between replicates
- GRIT score — evaluate phenotypic strenght ([GRIT](https://github.com/broadinstitute/grit-benchmark))

For more imformation on the replicate correlation and the grit score see the [cytominer-eval package](https://github.com/cytomining/cytominer-eval).

- Mean Average Precision (mAP) — assess intra- vs inter-group similarities ([copairs package](https://github.com/cytomining/copairs)).
# 📊 5. Downstream Analysis
After evaluation, continue with biological interpretation and visualization.

📄 03_downstream_analysis/03_analysis_evaluation.ipynb

Explore generated evaluation data:
- Explore experimental setup
- Correlation between replicates
- Grit and AP (average precision) per plates

📄 03_downstream_analysis/04_results_analysis.ipynb

Dive deeper into:
- Linking morphology to biological mechanisms
- Comparing compound activities
# 🧭 6. Learning Objectives
By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
- Understand the Cell Painting workflow from image data to feature-level insights
- Use PyCytominer to process, normalize, aggregate data
- Evaluate data reproducibility and activity using GRIT and mAP metrics
- Perform biological interpretation of morphological profiles
